# ZoomCongnito

This browser extension is an effort to make using zoom in the browser more comfortable and also help users to guard their privacy better (incognito/private window).

## Background

Due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 many companies and universities were in dire need of a solution for online meetings/lectures.
Which is why many quickly adapted [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) as their solution of choice, sadly the [zoom client had/has reportedly security flaws](https://www.securityweek.com/zoom-vulnerabilities-expose-users-spying-other-attacks) and was even [sued for allegedly handing over user data](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-sued-allegedly-sharing-data-with-facebook-2020-3?r=DE&IR=T).

Since this is all very concerning, but users are left with pretty much no choice, but to use it anyway, this extension comes into play, as an attempt to at least minimize the data which is shared with zoom.
